Hi, I'm Andrea! I am a Landscape Archaeologist and a researcher focused on the Near East, especially Iron Age.

I am currently working as research fellow at Sapienza University of Rome. 
Interested in my work? Check [my main website](https://www.andreatitolo.com)!

This blog is thought as a more lightweight place where I'll mostly write down my experiences and thoughts about everything that comes to mind.
